# Create a bootcamp using OOP

## A project made for DIO's JAVA bootcamp. 
## In this project there are courses and mentorships that will be part of the bootcamp and as the dev completes the bootcamp, the XP will add up. There are also free courses, which are not inside the bootcamp, to increase skills.
## The challenge is to create a bootcamp to learn object oriented in practice, using the 4 main pillars: 
## - Encapsulation
## - Abstraction
## - Inheritance
## - Polymorphism
