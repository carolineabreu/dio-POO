# Create a bootcamp using OOP

## A project made for DIO's JAVA bootcamp. 
## In this project there are courses and mentorships that will be part of the bootcamp and XP accounting as you complete it. There are also free courses, which are not inside the bootcamp, but you can do them to increase your skills.
## The challenge is to create a bootcamp to learn object oriented in practice, using the 4 main pillars: 
## - Encapsulation
## - Abstraction
## - Inheritance
## - Polymorphism
